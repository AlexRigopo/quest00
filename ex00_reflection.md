# ***Exercise 0: Honest Reflection on AI Use***
1. Write short, honest answers to these questions:
    - How have you used AI for coding so far?
    I have used AI in some parts of my coding so far, but most of the time it is to learn how to do things I don’t know. So I ask the AI to show me what to do and then teach me why and how it’s working.

    - Do you usually try problems yourself first?
    Yes, when I have to solve a problem first I try to break it down to smaller problems and solve them one by one.

    - Can you explain the code you've submitted without AI's help?
    Yes, I can, because even if I’ve had a part of my code AI generated I always ask the why and how the AI did it. So I can understand and learn ways of coding that evade my grasp.

    - What would happen if AI was unavailable during an exam or job test?
    Nothing. I would try to solve my problem part by part till everything is sorted.

2. Identify your current pattern:
Learner B: I utilize AI so I can access knowledge that would take me forever to find it.

3. When I started the program I had knowledge in coding, but it was mainly theoretical like algorithms and problem solving. In my current state I can firmly say that with practice and collaboration with peers and with correct usage of the AI I have learned ways of coding that I didn’t know before. The type of learner I would like to become is already set from the very first interactions I had within the program. I want to use AI in order to learn or deep research a project and then code it myself. Last but not least I know that even using AI we must never forget our peers. Their insight might enlighten us in ways we could think of. AI is a tool, not a peer.
