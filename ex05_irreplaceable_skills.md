# Exercise 5: Building Irreplaceable Skills

1. Problem Decomposition

    - 4/5

    - Need to pay more attention to the details.
2. Systems Thinking

    - 4/5

    - It's all about practice.
3. Critical Evaluation

    - 3/5
    
    - I can pinpoint wrong parts but I need to research further to be more efficient
4. Debugging Mindset

    - 4/5
    
    - This one goes along with the above. The better you become to the previous the more efficient you become in debugging.
5. Conceptual Understanding

    - 4/5
    
   - Knowing WHY is equal to being able to decomposite the problem. The HOW comes later. So by improving number 1 this one will follow.

# Improving Critical Evaluation

- In order to improve my Critical Evaluation I could look into older codes or ask a peer to review his/her code and then mark everything I think it needs improve, like duplicated or overly complex parts of code. 
- Another thing I could do is trying to rewrite a function in a different way for a example get a simple function and write a more efficient one or the other way around, in order to hone my skill. 
- Use a debugger in order to check where was time wasted for no reason or could be saved, any repeated or unnecessary work.
