# Exercise 4: Real-World Scenarios
1. ***Interview:***

    If you always rely on AI generated answers then your knowledge will be what we call surface knowledge. In an interview the major point is not just delivering a task but being able to reason why you did what you did. There is a good chance that the interviewer will go off script and start asking questions that can project your inability to support your work with words showing that you lack the knowledge to show that the ideas/solutions were originated by you.

2. ***Production Bug:***

    An Ai code generated some fair amount of time ago can create a big problem since there is a high possibility that the person who wrote the code doesn't fully understand which means that he/she won't be able to modify it without the help of an AI or it will consume a large amount of time trying to understand it on the spot. That can create a major issue on every system that requires results from this code. I.E: Security breaches, Data leaks, Production halt in a factory, wrong info comming to Air Traffic Controllers.

3. ***New Technology:***

    We must always keep in mind that AI is a tool. Only a person can come up with a new idea and evolve, transform or even create whole systems, it doesn't matter if it's organic, digital or mental. That's why it's our responsibility to first and foremost comprehend the new system like a new library and experiment with it, learning what it's needs and capabilities before we even think of AI. Once we have a fully understanding of the library we must teach it to an AI part by part, in order to achieve the machine learning potential to the fullest. Pretty much as a teacher does with his/her students. Even if he/she has a full scale knowledge about a lesson the students must be taught bit by bit, part by part in order to fully understand what they are learning.

## Fairly AI usage is Real-World preparing

If someone use AI as an all knowing mentor then he's in for a suprise when the mentor will be unavailable. As said earlier AI is a tool and the person is the craftsman, it must never be the other way around. If we use the AI to solve our problems then our mind will lose our imagination and that's the core difference between a programmer and an AI. If the programmer loses his/her imagination then they become replaceable because if the only thing you can do is writing code then the AI will replace you and it will always remain as it is. The goal here is to be ever evolving and that can only be achieved by problem solving. That way when a real challenge appears, one that AI cannot solve that's where fairly AI users can shine, since they will be the one who will be able to solve the problems ahead.
